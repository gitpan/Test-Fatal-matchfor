NAME
    Test::Fatal::matchfor - match exceptions by class name or regexp

SYNOPSIS
    Let's say you're testing the following Moose class...

       package Goose {
          use Moose;
          has feather_count => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');
       }

    In Moose 2.1102 and above, exception objects are thrown, but in earlier
    versions of Moose, only string errors are given.

    So we might want to test it something like this:

       use Test::More;
       use Test::Fatal;
   
       use Goose;
   
       my $e = exception {
          Goose->new(feather_count => 3.1)
       };
   
       ref($e)
          ? isa_ok($e, 'Moose::Exception::ValidationFailedForTypeConstraint')
          : like($e, qr{does not pass the type constraint})

    This module provides a small shortcut for that pattern:

       use Test::More;
       use Test::Fatal;
       use Test::Fatal::matchfor;
   
       use Goose;
   
       my $e = exception {
          Goose->new(feather_count => 3.1)
       };
   
       is(
          $e,
          matchfor(
             'Moose::Exception::ValidationFailedForTypeConstraint',
             qr{does not pass the type constraint},
          ),
       );

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Fatal::matchfor exports the `matchfor` function which accepts a list
    of class/role names and regular expressions, and constructs an object
    overloading `==` and `eq` to return true if compared for equality against
    a string that matches one of those regular expressions, or an object that
    isa/does one of those class/role names.

    So for example, to check a type constraint error in Moose, you might use:

       my $tc_err = matchfor(
          'Moose::Exception::ValidationFailedForTypeConstraint',
          'Moose::Exception::ValidationFailedForInlinedTypeConstraint',
          qr{does not pass the type constraint},
       ),
   
       is($exception, $tc_err, "encountered error as expected");
